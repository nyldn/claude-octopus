# Embrace - Complete Double Diamond Workflow

## 🤖 INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE

When the user invokes this command (e.g., `/octo:embrace <arguments>`):

### Step 1: Ask Clarifying Questions

**CRITICAL: Before starting the embrace workflow, use the AskUserQuestion tool to gather context:**

Ask 3 clarifying questions to ensure high-quality workflow execution:

```javascript
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [
    {
      question: "What's the scope of this project?",
      header: "Scope",
      multiSelect: false,
      options: [
        {label: "Small feature", description: "Single component or small addition"},
        {label: "Medium feature", description: "Multiple components or moderate complexity"},
        {label: "Large feature", description: "System-wide changes or new subsystem"},
        {label: "Full system", description: "Complete application or major architecture"}
      ]
    },
    {
      question: "What areas require the most attention?",
      header: "Focus Areas",
      multiSelect: true,
      options: [
        {label: "Architecture design", description: "System structure and design patterns"},
        {label: "Security", description: "Authentication, authorization, data protection"},
        {label: "Performance", description: "Speed, scalability, optimization"},
        {label: "User experience", description: "UI/UX and usability"}
      ]
    },
    {
      question: "What's your preferred level of autonomy?",
      header: "Autonomy",
      multiSelect: false,
      options: [
        {label: "Supervised (default)", description: "Review and approve after each phase"},
        {label: "Semi-autonomous", description: "Only intervene if quality gates fail"},
        {label: "Autonomous", description: "Run all 4 phases automatically"},
        {label: "Manual", description: "I'll guide each step explicitly"}
      ]
    }
  ]
})
```

**After receiving answers:**
- Store the context for use across all 4 phases
- Set autonomy mode based on user preference
- Proceed with the embrace workflow incorporating this context

### Step 2: Check Provider Availability & Display Banner

**Check which AI providers are available and display the visual indicator banner:**

First, check availability:
```bash
codex_available=$(command -v codex &> /dev/null && echo "✓" || echo "✗ Not installed")
gemini_available=$(command -v gemini &> /dev/null && echo "✓" || echo "✗ Not installed")
```

Then output the banner:
```
🐙 **CLAUDE OCTOPUS ACTIVATED** - Full Double Diamond Workflow
🐙 Embrace: [Brief description of what's being built]

All Phases:
🔍 Discover - Multi-provider research
🎯 Define - Consensus building
🛠️ Develop - Implementation with quality gates
✅ Deliver - Final validation and review

Provider Availability:
🔴 Codex CLI: [Available ✓ / Not installed ✗]
🟡 Gemini CLI: [Available ✓ / Not installed ✗]
🔵 Claude: Available ✓

Project Context:
Scope: [User's scope answer]
Focus: [User's focus areas]
Autonomy: [User's autonomy preference]
```

**If providers are missing:**
- Note in the banner which providers are unavailable
- Suggest running `/octo:setup` to configure missing providers
- Proceed with available providers only

### Step 3: Execute Workflow

Run the **complete 4-phase Double Diamond workflow** from research to delivery, passing the user context to each phase.

## Usage

```bash
/octo:embrace        # Full workflow with natural language
```

## What is Embrace?

**Embrace** 🐙 runs all four phases of the Double Diamond methodology in sequence:

1. **Discover** - Multi-perspective research (Codex + Gemini)
2. **Define** - Consensus building on problem/approach
3. **Develop** - Implementation with quality validation
4. **Deliver** - Final quality gates and output

## Natural Language Examples

Just describe what you want to build:

```
"Build a complete user authentication system"
"Create a caching layer from research to delivery"
"Design and implement a payment processing feature"
```

Claude will automatically use the embrace workflow for complex features that need thorough exploration.

## Autonomy Modes

You can configure how much human oversight you want:

- **Supervised** (default) - Approval required after each phase
- **Semi-autonomous** - Approval only when quality gates fail
- **Autonomous** - Runs all 4 phases automatically

Set in `/octo:setup` or use orchestrate.sh flags:
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/orchestrate.sh embrace --autonomy supervised "your prompt"
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/orchestrate.sh embrace --autonomy autonomous "your prompt"
```

## When to Use Embrace

Use embrace for:
- Complex features requiring research → implementation
- High-stakes projects needing validation
- Features where you want multiple AI perspectives
- When you need structured quality gates

Don't use for:
- Simple bug fixes or edits
- Quick research-only tasks (use discover phase)
- Code review only (use deliver phase)

## Quality Gates

The tangle (develop) phase includes automatic quality validation:
- 75% consensus threshold
- Security checks
- Best practices verification
- Performance considerations

If quality gates fail in semi-autonomous mode, you'll be prompted to review.
