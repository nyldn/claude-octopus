# Council evidence

Council seats use plan mode by default and cannot open files with file tools.
A path in the task does not supply that file's contents. Pass a readable file
with `--context-file`; repeat the flag for each artifact. Council includes the
contents in every seat's prompt as untrusted data.

```text
/octo:council --goal review --context-file ./src/service.ts "Review ./src/service.ts"
```

## Missing artifact context

Council warns before the advice phase when the task names a supported artifact
path and no context file was supplied. Supported forms include `/tmp/plan.md`,
`~/plans/review.diff`, `./src/service.ts`, and `../docs/design.md`. Bare filenames
such as `package.json` and prose without a supported path pass silently. The
check recognizes path text; it does not test whether that path exists.

Set `OCTOPUS_COUNCIL_REQUIRE_CONTEXT=1` in the runner environment to return exit
code 2 instead of warning. Supplying any context file suppresses this guard.
Include every artifact needed for the review; the guard does not check that
supplied files cover all task references.

## Source quote checks

Council can match distinctive response quotes against bounded source reads.
Injected instruction files do not count as source evidence. Excluded basenames
include `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE-OCTO.md`, `AGENTS-OCTO.md`, `GEMINI.md`,
`copilot-instructions.md`, `cursor.md`, and `cursorrules.md`, regardless of case
or directory. Existing hidden-path, private-file, symlink and scan limits apply.

By default, a matching source quote is sufficient for the content-match check.
To require a nearby filename mention as well, set
`OCTOPUS_COUNCIL_CONTENT_MATCH_PROXIMITY_CHARS=N` to a positive integer. Unset or
`0` retains the default. Values are capped at the response size limit.

The mention must have a basename reached by the bounded source scan, and one
quote occurrence must fall within `N` characters of that mention. Fenced lines
use their own response offsets. Duplicate source content can match before the
named file; scanning continues within the existing budgets to resolve names.

This option tightens the content-match signal. Basename resolution and proximity
do not prove that the quote came from that exact file or that a seat read it.
Validated citations and the council's other grounding paths still apply.
