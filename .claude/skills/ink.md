# Ink (Shortcut) - Deliver Phase ✅

This is a shortcut alias for `/co:flow-ink`.

**Part of Double Diamond: DELIVER** (convergent thinking)

## What This Does

The **ink** phase validates and reviews implementations using external CLI providers:

1. **🔴 Codex CLI** - Code quality, best practices, technical correctness
2. **🟡 Gemini CLI** - Security audit, edge cases, user experience
3. **🔵 Claude (You)** - Synthesis and final validation report

For full documentation, see `/co:flow-ink`.
