# Probe (Shortcut) - Discover Phase 🔍

This is a shortcut alias for `/co:flow-probe`.

**Part of Double Diamond: DISCOVER** (divergent thinking)

## What This Does

The **probe** phase executes multi-perspective research using external CLI providers:

1. **🔴 Codex CLI** - Technical implementation analysis, code patterns, framework specifics
2. **🟡 Gemini CLI** - Broad ecosystem research, community insights, alternative approaches
3. **🔵 Claude (You)** - Strategic synthesis and recommendation

For full documentation, see `/co:flow-probe`.
