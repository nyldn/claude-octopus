# Grasp (Shortcut) - Define Phase 🎯

This is a shortcut alias for `/co:flow-grasp`.

**Part of Double Diamond: DEFINE** (convergent thinking)

## What This Does

The **grasp** phase clarifies and scopes problems using external CLI providers:

1. **🔴 Codex CLI** - Technical requirements analysis, edge cases, constraints
2. **🟡 Gemini CLI** - User needs, business requirements, context understanding
3. **🔵 Claude (You)** - Problem synthesis and requirement definition

For full documentation, see `/co:flow-grasp`.
