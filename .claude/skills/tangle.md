# Tangle (Shortcut) - Develop Phase 🛠️

This is a shortcut alias for `/co:flow-tangle`.

**Part of Double Diamond: DEVELOP** (divergent thinking)

## What This Does

The **tangle** phase generates multiple implementation approaches using external CLI providers:

1. **🔴 Codex CLI** - Implementation-focused, code generation, technical patterns
2. **🟡 Gemini CLI** - Alternative approaches, edge cases, best practices
3. **🔵 Claude (You)** - Integration, refinement, and final implementation

For full documentation, see `/co:flow-tangle`.
