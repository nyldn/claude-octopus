# Define - Definition Phase 🎯

**Part of Double Diamond: DEFINE** (convergent thinking)

Clarify and scope problems using external CLI providers.

## Usage

```bash
/co:define         # Definition phase
```

## Natural Language Examples

Just describe what you want to clarify:

```
"Define the requirements for user authentication"
"Clarify the scope of the caching feature"
"What exactly does the notification system need to do?"
"Scope out the API versioning feature"
```

## What This Phase Does

The **define** phase clarifies and scopes problems using external CLI providers:

1. **🔴 Codex CLI** - Technical requirements analysis, edge cases, constraints
2. **🟡 Gemini CLI** - User needs, business requirements, context understanding
3. **🔵 Claude (You)** - Problem synthesis and requirement definition

This is the **convergent** phase - we take the broad research from discover and narrow it down to a clear problem statement.

## When to Use Define

Use define when you need:
- **Requirements**: "Define the requirements for X"
- **Clarification**: "Clarify the scope of Y"
- **Scoping**: "What exactly does X need to do?"
- **Problem Understanding**: "Help me understand the problem with Y"
- **Feature Scoping**: "Scope out the Z feature"
- **Specific Requirements**: "What are the specific requirements for X?"

**Don't use define for:**
- Implementation tasks (use develop phase)
- Research tasks (use discover phase)
- Review tasks (use deliver phase)

## Part of the Full Workflow

Define is phase 2 of 4 in the embrace (full) workflow:
1. Discover
2. **Define** ← You are here
3. Develop
4. Deliver

To run all 4 phases: `/co:embrace`
