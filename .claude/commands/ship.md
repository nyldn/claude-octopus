# Ship

Finalize a project after delivery checks pass.

Execution guidance:
1. Run the `skill-ship` workflow.
2. Validate readiness, quality, and unresolved blockers before shipping.
3. If checks pass, produce a clear ship summary and checkpoint details.
4. If checks fail, return a concise remediation checklist instead of shipping.
